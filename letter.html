                            My babyyyyy ❤️<br><br>
                            As the year is about to end, I just want to tell you how I find myself thinking less about
                            days and more about us.
                            About how unexpectedly you became such an important part of my life and how quietly you
                            changed me for the better.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You became my calm on difficult days and my happiness on ordinary ones.
                            Being with you taught me patience, understanding, and what it truly means to care.
                            I didn’t just fall in love with you, I discovered a side of myself I never knew existed.
                            Being with you makes me the happiest person, and you showed me how it truly feels to be
                            loved.
                            To have someone who genuinely cares, and someone so cute and gorgeous who chose me.
                            I never thought any of this would be possible.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Even with the distance, you never felt far.
                            You were always in my thoughts, in my heart, and in everything I looked forward to.
                            You made me smile when I didn't know I needed to and showed me that love can feel safe
                            and real.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As we step into a new year, I don't know exactly what life has planned,
                            but I know I want to face it with you.
                            Every challenge, every win, every small moment. I need you for everything..
                            I choose you today and every day that comes next. And i genuinely feel so grateful and
                            blessed for having you and thank you for always choosing me.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Thank you for loving me, believing in us, and being my person.
                        </p>
